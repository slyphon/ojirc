ojirc: it's a killer!

This is an implementation of an IRC protocol client in clojure. The first thing
I usually write when I'm learning a language is an IRC bot. Unfortunately,
there's already clojurebot (which wraps PircBot, which is how I was planning on
doing it), and rather than do a half-assed job at duplicating someone else's
work, I decided to do a half-assed job doing something original. 

More to follow as this project becomes whole-assed.
